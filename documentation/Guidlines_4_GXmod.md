# Guidelines

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module will be re-inovated and produced as a seperat module. This .md, is segrigated into different sections,
in which we will discuss in great detail. First, we will talk about the credits. Our cridits go the authors of resources 
that you use and, if required, include the license, and for all the users who has forked this GX mod template and guidlines.
NOTE: To keep the icons future ready, provide 512x512 PNG format, for consistancy and ease of access. Try to Keep audio files 
in mp3 format, joint stereo, variable bitrate 145-180kbps. Optimize resources to limit download size.

## Music:

Provide at least one music track that is perfectly looped.
If possible, use [vertical remixing](mods.md#background-music) to achieve a dynamic music effect.
Follow volume of music from [Mod_Template](Mod_Template/music).

## Browser Sounds:

Provide sounds for all categories. If possible, have more than one sound for each type, varying pitch/volume, etc.
Be mindful of sounds that are played more frequently. Opening and closing tabs, clicks, and hovers will be heard often.
Make sure it's an enjoyable experience. Sounds need to be short and start immediately to feel responsive. Make sure there's 
no silence at the beginning. Folow volume of browser sounds from [Mod_Template](Mod_Template/sound).

## Keyboard Sounds:

Provide sounds for ENTER, BACKSPACE, SPACE, and other keys. If possible, have more than one sound for each type, 
varying pitch/volume, etc. Make sure that typing is enjoyable. Sounds need to be short and start immediately to feel
responsive. Make sure there's no silence at the beginning. It's important for keyboard sounds, as any delay will feel laggy.
It's advised to use WAV format. Folow volume of keyboard sounds from [Mod_Template](Mod_Template/keyboard).

## Shaders as we know it:

Optimize your shaders to use as little GPU as possible. If you create an animated shader, make sure to limit 
the framerate as much as possible to avoid useless GPU usage. For example, a clock that changes display every
second doesn't need to run at 60fps. Use as few uniforms as possible. Don't use iMouse uniform unless you need it
- it has performance implications. Consider including a non-animated version of the shader to limit GPU usage
- (mods can include more than one shader).

## About the Theming:

Provide light and dark versions. If a wallpaper is included, make sure it creates an enjoyable composition.
Note that too light or too dark colors are not available. It's advised to use the built-in color picker.

## About Wallpapers:

Please go through [GX wallpapers guildelines](GXWallpaperGuidelines.pdf) that explain safe zones and etc.

The resolution should be at least 1920x1080. Keep images in JPG format to limit the size of the mod. Provide light 
and dark versions.Be mindful of content that is shown over the wallpaper. Ensure that it's not distracting. Move key 
objects to sides that are not going to be covered with content. Think about lower resolutions and different aspect ratios.
Pick color and shadow color (for light and dark themes) for elements displayed on the start page. For animated wallpapers, 
please stick with a maximum 1920x1080 resolution; otherwise, it might be too resource-hungry. Keep them short and perfectly 
looped to keep mod size under control. Use VP9 video format if possible for best performance.
